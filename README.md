The bot is designed to meet the needs of my Discord server, using it
elsewhere may not work for now...

The goal is to have a bot for each long and complex task to simplify 
moderation. The bot is not designed to be "revolutionary" but efficient. 
It is coded in python, all the bot code is in the same file (except the 
token)
